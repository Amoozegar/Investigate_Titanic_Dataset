Titanic dataset Contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. 
I tried to investigate the dataset by proposing some questions and answering them. This project is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. The whole procedure is explained in the PDF file and also the code is provided in Jupyter Notebook.
